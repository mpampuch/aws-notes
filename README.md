Some tips / things of notes for myself while I'm learning AWS

## AWS User Accounts and Best Practices

### AWS Root User

- The **root user** is created when you first set up an AWS account. It is tied to the email address used to create the account.
- The root user has **full, unrestricted access** to all resources in the AWS account.
- The root user credentials (email and password) are separate from IAM users and are used to log in to the AWS Management Console.

#### What is the root user for?

- The root user is intended for **account setup and emergency tasks only**.
- Examples of root-only tasks:
  - Changing account settings (e.g., billing info, closing account)
  - Restoring IAM user access
  - Managing some security credentials (e.g., root access keys)

#### Should the root user spin up servers or manage resources?

- **No.** The root user should **not** be used for day-to-day operations, including spinning up servers, managing S3 buckets, or configuring services.
- Instead, create **IAM users** with the necessary permissions for regular tasks.

### Setting Up Users Correctly

1. **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on the root account**

   - This is the most important security step. Use a hardware or virtual MFA device.

2. **Create individual IAM users for each person or application**

   - Never share user accounts or credentials.
   - Assign each user only the permissions they need (principle of least privilege).

3. **Use Groups and Roles**

   - Assign permissions to groups, then add users to groups for easier management.
   - Use IAM roles for applications, services, or cross-account access.

4. **Disable or delete root access keys**

   - If you must create root access keys, delete them as soon as possible.
   - Use IAM user access keys for programmatic access.

5. **Monitor and audit account activity**

   - Enable AWS CloudTrail to log all account activity.
   - Regularly review IAM policies and user activity.

6. **Rotate credentials regularly**

   - Change passwords and access keys on a regular schedule.

7. **Use Service Control Policies (SCPs) with AWS Organizations**
   - For multi-account setups, use SCPs to enforce permission boundaries.

### Best Practices Summary

- **Root user = emergency only**
- **MFA on root and all users**
- **No root access keys**
- **Use IAM users, groups, and roles**
- **Principle of least privilege**
- **Monitor and audit regularly**

For more details, see the official AWS documentation on [Best Practices for Managing AWS Access Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-access-keys-best-practices.html) and [IAM Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html).

## IAM Users

**Identity and Access Management (IAM) users** are entities that represent a person or application that interacts with AWS resources. Unlike the root user, IAM users are created within your AWS account and have specific permissions assigned to them.

### What are IAM Users?

- **Individual identities** for people or applications that need access to AWS
- **Separate from the root user** - they have their own username and password
- **Granular permissions** - you control exactly what they can and cannot do
- **Programmatic access** - can have access keys for API/CLI usage
- **Console access** - can log into the AWS Management Console

### How to Set Up IAM Users

#### 1. Create a New IAM User

**Via AWS Console:**

1. Go to IAM service in AWS Console
2. Click "Users" â†’ "Add user"
3. Enter username and select access type:
   - **Console access**: For web-based access
   - **Programmatic access**: For API/CLI access
   - **Both**: For full access

**Via AWS CLI:**

```bash
# Create user
aws iam create-user --user-name myuser

# Create access key (for programmatic access)
aws iam create-access-key --user-name myuser

# Create login profile (for console access)
aws iam create-login-profile --user-name myuser --password MyPassword123!
```

#### 2. Assign Permissions

**Option A: Attach Managed Policies**

- Use AWS pre-built policies (e.g., `AmazonS3FullAccess`, `AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess`)
- Quick and easy, but may grant more permissions than needed

**Option B: Create Custom Policies**

- Write JSON policies with exact permissions needed
- More secure, follows principle of least privilege

**Option C: Add to Groups**

- Create groups with specific permissions
- Add users to groups for easier management

#### 3. Set Up Security

**Enable MFA:**

- Require multi-factor authentication for console access
- Use virtual MFA apps (Google Authenticator, Authy) or hardware devices

**Password Policy:**

- Set minimum length, complexity requirements
- Require password changes periodically

**Access Key Rotation:**

- Regularly rotate access keys (every 90 days recommended)
- Delete unused access keys

### IAM User Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive usernames** (e.g., `john.doe`, `webapp-service`)
2. **One user per person/application** - never share accounts
3. **Start with minimal permissions** - add more as needed
4. **Use groups for permission management** - easier to maintain
5. **Enable MFA for all users** with console access
6. **Regular access reviews** - remove unused users and permissions
7. **Use IAM Access Analyzer** to identify unused permissions
8. **Monitor user activity** with CloudTrail

### Example: Creating a Developer User

```bash
# Create user
aws iam create-user --user-name developer

# Add to developers group
aws iam add-user-to-group --user-name developer --group-name developers

# Create access key
aws iam create-access-key --user-name developer

# Create login profile
aws iam create-login-profile --user-name developer --password TempPass123!
```

### Common IAM Policies

- **AdministratorAccess**: Full access (use sparingly)
- **PowerUserAccess**: Full access except IAM management
- **ReadOnlyAccess**: View-only access to all services
- **AmazonS3FullAccess**: Full S3 access
- **AmazonEC2FullAccess**: Full EC2 access
- **AmazonRDSFullAccess**: Full RDS access

### Security Checklist

- [ ] MFA enabled for console access
- [ ] Strong password policy configured
- [ ] Access keys rotated regularly
- [ ] Unused users and permissions removed
- [ ] CloudTrail enabled for audit logging
- [ ] IAM Access Analyzer used to find unused permissions
- [ ] Users added to appropriate groups
- [ ] Custom policies used instead of broad managed policies when possible

## Access Keys

- Access Keys are a **key and secret** required to have programmatic access to AWS resources when interacting with the AWS API **outside of the AWS Management Console**

- An Access Key is commonly referred to as **AWS Credentials** (this term includes both keys and secrets)

  - You get both Key and Secret when you generate credentials

- A user must be **granted access** to use Access Keys

  - When you create a new user within your AWS account, you get to choose "do they have programmatic access?"
    - If they do then you can generate AWS Acces Keys for them

- You can have two active Access Keys

  - If you need more you need to deactivate or delete one

- **Access Key have whatever access a user has to AWS resources**

  - If you are an admin user, your access keys will have admin user privileges.
  - Cannot set seperate permissions for individual access keys
    - If you need this, look into setting up a machine user

- **Never share your AWS credentials**
  - Never accidentally commit them to a codebase (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, etc.)

### How to Save Access Keys Locally?

There are 2 ways to set access keys locally.

1. You can put them in a credentials file
2. You can create an environment variable

#### Creating a Credentials File

Access keys are stored in `~/.aws/credentials` and follow a INI file format (similar to a TOML file format)

```ini
[default]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAEXAMPLEDEFAULT
aws_secret_access_key = abc123exampleSecretKeyDefault

[user123]
aws_access_key_id = AKIAEXAMPLEUSER123
aws_secret_access_key = abc123exampleSecretKeyUser123
regin = ca-central-1
```

`default` will be the access key used when no profile is specified.

You can store multiple access keys by giving the profile names (e.g. `user123`)

You can use the `aws configure` CLI command to populate the credentials file. This will automatically create the INI file.

```bash
$ aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIAEXAMPLE123456
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: abc123exampleSecretKey
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json
```

#### Creating an Environment Variable

You can also set your credentials using environmental variables

```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=AKIAEXAMPLE123456
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=abc123exampleSecretKey
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

The AWS SDK and CLI will automatically read from these environmental variables. **Environmental variables are a good way to set credentials especially on cloud developer environments where you can't set a credentials file.**

## AWS CLI Autoprompt

AWS CLI **Auto-prompt** is an interactive feature that helps you build commands step-by-step.

### How It Works

- Type `aws` followed by a service name and press Tab
- CLI will prompt you for required parameters
- Provides suggestions and validates input
- Helps prevent syntax errors

### Enabling Auto-prompt

```bash
# Enable for current session
export AWS_CLI_AUTO_PROMPT=on-partial

# Enable for specific command
aws s3 ls --cli-auto-prompt on-partial
```

### Auto-prompt Modes

- **off**: Disabled (default)
- **on**: Full auto-prompt
- **on-partial**: Auto-prompt only when you press Tab

### Benefits

- Faster command building
- Learn AWS CLI syntax interactively
- Reduce typos and errors
- Discover available options and parameters

## AWS Free Tier

- **Snapshots**: EBS snapshots beyond free tier are charged
- **Load Balancers**: Running 24/7 can exceed free tier quickly
- **RDS**: Multi-AZ deployments are not free tier eligible

#### Best Practices for Free Tier

1. **Set up billing alerts**

   ```bash
   # Create billing alarm via CLI
   aws cloudwatch put-metric-alarm \
     --alarm-name "FreeTierAlert" \
     --alarm-description "Alert when approaching free tier limits" \
     --metric-name EstimatedCharges \
     --namespace AWS/Billing \
     --statistic Maximum \
     --period 86400 \
     --threshold 5 \
     --comparison-operator GreaterThanThreshold
   ```

2. **Monitor usage regularly**

   - Check AWS Cost Explorer
   - Review monthly billing statements
   - Use AWS Budgets for spending limits

3. **Clean up unused resources**

   - Terminate EC2 instances when not needed
   - Delete unused EBS volumes
   - Remove old S3 objects
   - Stop RDS instances during development

4. **Use appropriate instance types**
   - Stick to t2.micro for EC2
   - Use db.t2.micro for RDS
   - Choose free tier eligible services

### Free Tier Calculator

Use the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/) to estimate costs beyond free tier limits.

### Free Tier Expiration

- **12 months** from account creation date
- **No automatic notification** when free tier expires
- **Immediate billing** starts when free tier ends
- **Always free services** continue indefinitely

### Tips for Staying Within Free Tier

1. **Start small**: Begin with minimal resources
2. **Use spot instances**: For non-critical workloads
3. **Optimize storage**: Use appropriate storage classes
4. **Monitor closely**: Set up CloudWatch alarms
5. **Document usage**: Track what you're using
6. **Plan ahead**: Know when free tier expires

- **Block Device Mapping**: How volumes are attached
- **Kernel/Ramdisk**: Boot configuration (if needed)

### Creating AMIs

1. **From Running Instance**: Create AMI from existing instance
2. **From Snapshot**: Create AMI from EBS snapshot
3. **From S3**: Import VM from S3 (for on-premises migration)

### Best Practices

- Keep AMIs updated with security patches
- Use descriptive names and tags
- Test AMIs before sharing or using in production
- Consider using AWS Systems Manager for automated AMI management

## AWS Root Device Type

The **Root Device Type** determines how the root volume is stored and managed.

### Types

- **EBS-backed**: Root volume is an EBS volume

  - Can be stopped and started (data persists)
  - Supports EBS snapshots
  - Can be resized
  - Better for production workloads

- **Instance Store-backed**: Root volume is ephemeral storage
  - Cannot be stopped (only terminated)
  - Data is lost when instance stops/terminates
  - Higher I/O performance
  - Lower cost
  - Good for temporary workloads

### Key Differences

| Feature          | EBS-backed | Instance Store-backed |
| ---------------- | ---------- | --------------------- |
| Data Persistence | Yes        | No                    |
| Stop/Start       | Yes        | No                    |
| Snapshot Support | Yes        | No                    |
| Volume Resize    | Yes        | No                    |
| Performance      | Good       | Better                |
| Cost             | Higher     | Lower                 |

### Choosing the Right Type

- **Use EBS-backed for**:

  - Production workloads
  - Data that needs to persist
  - Instances that need to be stopped/started
  - When you need snapshots

- **Use Instance Store-backed for**:
  - Temporary workloads
  - High-performance requirements
  - Cost-sensitive applications
  - When data persistence isn't required
